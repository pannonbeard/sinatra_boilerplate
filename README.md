# Sinatra MVC boilerplate
Sinatra is a very open framework for building ruby apps. While it is fast to get a static site up and running a little bit of configuration is needed to help produce a consistent MVC. I'm putting this together for selfish reasons. I am trying to step out of my vein of just building Ruby on Rails applications and try another venue for app development with ruby.

## Overview
This boilerplate does attempt to give a jumping off point for an mvc app.

## Getting up and going
Run the following in a terminal in the root directory of this repo to get up and going
```
bundle install
rake db:create
foreman start
```
